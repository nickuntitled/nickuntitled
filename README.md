I’m @nickuntitled (Kittisak Chotikkakamthorn)

An experienced engineer with medical and engineering degrees developed machine learning/deep learning, deployed the trained model on production with the limited server resources, and applied machine learning models to solve medical problems.

My focused interest is related to Python, SQL, Docker, Git, Linux, Machine Learning (with Deep Learning framework from PyTorch/Tensorflow), Computer Vision, and Applied Artificial Intelligence in Medicine.
