ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nickuntitled (Kittisak Chotikkakamthorn)

A former engineering internship with experiences in machine learning/deep learning development and optimization, combined with model deployment on production with the limited server resources, applications of machine learning to solve medical problems, and medical and engineering degrees.

My focused interest is related to Python, SQL, Docker, Git, Linux, Machine Learning (with Deep Learning framework from PyTorch/Tensorflow), Computer Vision, and Applied Artificial Intelligence in Medicine. For those who are interested, follow me on [https://nickuntitled.com](https://nickuntitled.com) or [Linkedin](www.linkedin.com/in/kittisak-chotikkakamthorn-09a7b3118).
